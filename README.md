# ClientPanel
This is a project using Angular 4.
This app is a client management system. It allows the user to see a list of clients, add to the client list, update the clients
and delete clients all through a user interface. The backend uses Firebase which is a cloud database maintained by Google and is a good replacement for a 
backend when trying to make sure it works as intended.
Views of the dashboard, details page, edit and delete pages can be seen by looking at the .pngs above. Font awesome, bootstrap and html
were all used to create the user interface pages. Right now all the buttons work except Register and Login which I still need
to code the functionality.
